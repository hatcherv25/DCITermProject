          <p>The Mock Convention at Washington and Lee is the most accurate mock convention in the nation, accurately predicting the presidential nominee for the party out of power 20 out of 27 times since 1908.</p>
          <p>The entirely student-comprised team behind the 2024 cycle of Mock Convention has set an unprecedented fundraising goal of $1,275,500 in hopes of creating an unparalleled experience for students, parents, faculty, and alumni. The budget is a direct reflection of the speakers Mock Convention hopes to bring to campus. The photo to the left shows Virginia and her parents at the first speaker event of this cycle during which Mock Convention welcomed Laura and Barbara Bush to University Chapel.</p>
          <p>As alumni chair, Virginia oversees the fundraising committee alongside the fundraising chair, organizes chapter visits and open houses to engage with alumni across the country, constructs the timeline and content of mailings and emails to alumni and parents, and attends small meetings with potential donors and offices across W&Lâ€™s campus.</p>
